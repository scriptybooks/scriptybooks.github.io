<h2>Recap</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick recap of the RailsConf 2013 keynotes from David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) and Yehuda Katz:</p>

<p>First, David explained Rails 4&#8217;s firm commitment to server-side programming and provided an overview of Russian-doll caching, turbolinks, JavaScript helpers, and other details. The content of his keynote
was remarkably similar to his blog post of over a year before, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3112-how-basecamp-next-got-to-be-so-damn-fast-without-using-much-client-side-ui">How Basecamp Next got to be so damn fast without using much client-side UI</a>.</p>

<p>Yehuda&#8217;s keynote was an energetic, well-researched rebuttal to David&#8217;s that included many memorable sound-bites, such as
&#8220;2012: The Year Rubyists Wrote Off JS Libraries.&#8221; I&#8217;ll update this post with a link to it when it becomes available on ConFreaks, as it&#8217;s so worth watching.</p>

<h2>Themes</h2>

<p>The two sought to differentiate their approaches to modern Web apps on three major themes, as I see it.</p>

<p>The first theme, <strong>mental model</strong>, is simply where your mind lives when you program your application. Are you writing Rails for the server or
JavaScript for the client? This is pretty much a matter of taste, but as you can imagine, in the heart of Rubyland the burden of proof was
on Yehuda for this one. It was enough for David to simply state that &#8220;I like Ruby better.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second theme is the <strong>organization</strong> of JavaScript&#8211;or the lack of it, as Yehuda would point out, blaming the &#8220;Sprinkles of JavaScript&#8221;
mentality for much <em>ad hoc</em> JavaScript programming. Unfortunately, David has never revealed much about the substantial
CoffeeScript portion of Basecamp, except to say that of the 10k or so lines of code, roughly a third is the
Backbone-based calendar (a client-side app). Rails 4 will not provide any new facilities for organizing client-side code,
as far as I know, which is a disappointment considering the innovations of the Rails Asset Pipeline.</p>

<p>The third theme is the most technical and also by far the most interesting for me personally. This is the question of where to <strong>render HTML</strong>, on the server or the client? I thought the best part of David&#8217;s keynote was when he argued that the great strength of HTML is
its orientation toward documents, and further, that many web applications are appropriately document-centric. He provided examples of how small
user-specific variations in documents could be made on the client, allowing a single master representation to be cached for all users on the server.
Yehuda, arguing for rendering to be done on the client from JSON delivered from the server, attempted to use David&#8217;s examples as evidence that significant JavaScript programming is still required, and urged the audience to &#8220;embrace JavaScript.&#8221;</p>

<h2>My Conclusions</h2>

<p>I enjoyed Yehuda&#8217;s keynote and agree with almost everything he says when he&#8217;s saying it (he&#8217;s such a great speaker.)</p>

<p>But as I
reflected afterward on his evidence for client-side rendering, I immediately felt that something was amiss. If a high-enough percentage of
web content is exactly the same for all users with access to the web resource, then it really makes sense to do the rendering <em>once</em> on the server,
cache the result, and save clients the trouble and time of rendering <em>all</em> of the content using JavaScript. And I wonder what that &#8220;high-enough&#8221; number really is? In the end, it may just be whatever you&#8217;re hoping to see first as your underpowered device loads the page over a slow connection.</p>

<p>Yehuda&#8217;s approach has elegance on its side, while David&#8217;s is a much uglier hybrid. But the hybrid appears to have
serious performance advantages. If you haven&#8217;t already, you must read about Twitter&#8217;s experience with and partial retreat from client-side rendering in the <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/05/improving-performance-on-twittercom.html">&#8220;time to first tweet&#8221;</a> post of May 29, 2012.</p>

<p>As always, a one-size-fits-all, one-tool-for-every-job approach is likely to lead to trouble. So you need to ask yourself, how document-oriented is
your application?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been intending to open-source the important parts of the ScriptyBooks stack since the beginning, but I never felt
right about sharing it as a Rails app. My original <em>bookserver</em> was a simple Node.js app and a command-line build tool, and that seemed like a
better path for open source, although I didn&#8217;t get far down it before practical concerns on the business side led me to
switch to Ruby, Nokogiri, and Rails.</p>

<h3>Enter the Jekyll</h3>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> + <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is pretty cool stuff. Out of the box, the default blog doesn&#8217;t look like much&#8230;.
but the cmd-line blogging tool is solid. It leverages git and GitHub to the max.
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">Deploying</a> to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is dialed in with its own <code>source</code> branch.
Octopress even includes tasks for updating from the original project:
Here&#8217;s how you <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/updating/">update the software</a>, all git based. I should have clued into this stuff a long time ago.</p>

<p>I think the git usage will impress you. Here&#8217;s a little taste of the experience:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>csmith:scriptybooks.github.io vitalvu$ git status
</span><span class='line'># On branch master
</span><span class='line'># Your branch is ahead of 'octopress/master' by 5 commits.
</span><span class='line'>#
</span><span class='line'>nothing to commit (working directory clean)
</span><span class='line'>csmith:scriptybooks.github.io vitalvu$ git checkout source
</span><span class='line'>Switched to branch 'source'
</span><span class='line'>Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
</span><span class='line'>and have 5 and 5 different commits each, respectively.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The messages about the branches diverging are nothing to worry about. They just show you&#8217;ve been busy with your blog.</p>

<h3>What do you think?</h3>

<p>Is Jekyll the right approach for writing interactive Web books? Please leave a comment. Oooops you can&#8217;t, because I didn&#8217;t
enable the Disqus plugin (I can&#8217;t stand the ads that Disqus has been showing.) I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;d be cool to have a comment widget that
uses <a href="http://www.firebase.com">Firebase</a>. What about that idea? Anyone want to help? Arrggh, until I have it done, you still can&#8217;t comment. (Tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/quartzmo">@quartzmo</a> instead.)</p>
